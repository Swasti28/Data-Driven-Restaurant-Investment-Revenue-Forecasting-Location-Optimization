# **Data-Driven Restaurant Investment: Revenue Forecasting & Location Optimization**

## **📌 Overview**
This project applies **data mining, machine learning, and financial analysis** to optimize restaurant investment decisions. Using **statistical modeling, neural networks, and decision trees**, we analyzed the **revenue-driving factors** of restaurants in the **Tri-state area** and assessed the **profitability of opening a restaurant** in New Jersey. 

### **📊 Key Objectives:**
- **Identify key revenue drivers** using **regression analysis & neural networks**.
- **Evaluate the impact of restaurant location, take-out services, and outdoor dining**.
- **Use decision trees to segment profitable restaurant locations**.
- **Compare machine learning models (Neural Networks vs. Regression Models)**.
- **Assess financial viability & profitability for new restaurant investments**.

## **📍 Part 1: Restaurant Revenue Analysis (Regression & Neural Networks)**

### **📝 Problem Statement**
We analyzed **revenue patterns among restaurants** using statistical techniques and machine learning to determine the best investment strategy. 

### **📊 Methodology:**
✔ **Regression Analysis (Multiple Linear Regression)** – Identified significant revenue predictors.  
✔ **Neural Network (Multi-Layer Perceptron - MLP)** – Improved revenue forecasting accuracy.  
✔ **Correlation Matrix Analysis** – Determined relationships between variables like location, income level, and take-out services.  

### **📌 Key Findings:**
- **Outdoor dining and take-out services** positively correlated with revenue.
- **App presence did NOT significantly impact revenue**.
- **Town Population & Area Income** were the strongest revenue drivers.
- **Neural Networks outperformed regression models** in revenue prediction.

## **📍 Part 2: Restaurant Location Optimization (Decision Trees & Segmentation)**

### **📝 Problem Statement**
Using **decision tree models** and **segmentation analysis**, we evaluated whether investing in a restaurant **within 3 miles of the town center in New Jersey** would be profitable.

### **📊 Methodology:**
✔ **Decision Tree Analysis** – Used Python’s **Scikit-Learn** to extract insights from location data.  
✔ **Market Segmentation (SAS Partitioning)** – Identified **high-revenue restaurant locations**.
✔ **Financial Analysis** – Evaluated **profitability with & without a restaurant app**.
✔ **Profit & Loss Forecasting** – Assessed break-even points and long-term revenue trends.

### **📌 Key Findings:**
- **Outdoor dining + Take-out services** = **Highest revenue locations**.
- **Restaurants near population centers (205K-295K people)** performed best.
- **App investment was NOT profitable** (-$72,288 avg revenue loss per month).
- **Predicted Monthly Revenue:** **$621,083** 💰 | **Profit Margin:** **+49.8%**
